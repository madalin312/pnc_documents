- (1) General Requirements . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these Bylaws, whenever the Board solicits proxies with respect to the election of directors at an annual meeting of shareholders, the Corporation shall include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting of shareholders, in addition to any persons nominated for election by the Board (or any committee thereof), the name, together with the Required Information (as defined in Section 2.3(2) below), of any person nominated for election (the " Shareholder Nominee ") to the Board by one (1) or more shareholders that satisfy the requirements of this Section 2.3, including qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder (as defined in Section 2.3(5) below), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the

6

written notice required by this Section 2.3 (a " Proxy Access Notice ") to have its nominee included in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.3. For the purposes of this Section 2.3:

- (a) " Voting Shares " shall mean outstanding shares entitled to vote generally for the election of directors;
- (b) " Constituent Holder " shall mean any shareholder, fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined in Section 2.3(5) below) or beneficial holder whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as holding the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (as defined in Section 2.3(5) below) or qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder (as defined in Section 2.3(5) below);
- (c) a shareholder shall be deemed to " own " only those Voting Shares that such shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) possesses both (i) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (ii) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares. The number of Voting Shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the shareholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (A) sold by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of their respective affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (B) borrowed by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of their respective affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of their respective affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell or (C) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of their respective affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Shares, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (X) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder's or Constituent Holder's (or any of their respective affiliate's) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (Y) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of their respective affiliates), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multiindustry market index fund in which Voting Shares represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index. A person shall "own" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the person retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the person has loaned such shares provided that the person has the unrestricted

7

power to recall such loaned shares on five (5) (or fewer) business days' notice and during any period in which the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which is revocable at any time by the person. The terms "owned," "owning" and other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings. Whether Voting Shares are "owned" for these purposes shall be determined by the Board or any committee thereof, in each case, in its sole discretion.

(2) Required Information for Proxy. For purposes of this Section 2.3, the " Required Information " that the Corporation will include in its proxy statement is (a) the information concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that the Corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the Corporation's proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (b) if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a Statement (as defined in Section 2.3(7) below). The Corporation shall also include the name of the Shareholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these Bylaws notwithstanding, the Corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Shareholder and/or Shareholder Nominee, including any information provided to the Corporation with respect to the foregoing.

(3) Delivery of Proxy Access Notice. To be timely, a Proxy Access Notice shall be delivered to the Corporate Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred fiftieth (150 th ) day and not later than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120 th ) day prior to the first anniversary of the filing date of the definitive proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the public announcement (as defined in Section 2.4(2) below) thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.

(4) Maximum Number of Shareholder Nominees. The maximum number of Shareholder Nominees nominated by all Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 2.3 (including Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.3 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board decides to nominate as Board nominees) appearing in the Corporation's proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders shall not exceed the greater of (a) two (2) and (b) the largest whole number that does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 (such greater number, the " Permitted Number "); provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by the number of directors in office that will be included in the Corporation's proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom access to the Corporation's proxy materials was previously provided (or requested) pursuant to this Section 2.3, other than

8

any such director referred to in this proviso who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board, for at least two (2) annual terms; provided, further, that in the event the Board resolves to reduce the size of the Board effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 2.3 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Shareholder will select one (1) Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of Voting Shares each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has selected one (1) Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.

(5) Eligible Shareholder. For purposes of this Section 2.3, an " Eligible Shareholder " is one (1) or more shareholders of record who (a) own and have owned, or is acting on behalf of one (1) or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined in Section 2.3(1)(c) above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation, and as of the record date for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the Voting Shares (the " Proxy Access Request Required Shares "), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting; provided, that the aggregate number of shareholders and, if and to the extent that a shareholder is acting on behalf of one (1) or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20) and (b) otherwise individually meet the requirements of this Section 2.3. Two (2) or more funds that are (i) under common management and investment control, (ii) under common management and funded primarily by a single employer or (iii) a "group of investment companies," as such term is defined, as of the date these Bylaws were amended to add this Section 2.3, in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (such funds together under each of (i), (ii) or (iii), a " Qualifying Fund ") shall be treated as one (1) shareholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shareholders in this paragraph (5), provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this Section 2.3. No shares may be attributed to more than one (1) group constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 2.3 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no shareholder may be a member of more than one (1) group constituting an Eligible Shareholder). A record holder acting on behalf of a beneficial owner will not be counted separately as a shareholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.3(5), for purposes of determining the number of shareholders

9

whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Shareholder's holdings. For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three (3)-year period ending on that date and through the other applicable dates referred to above (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).

- (6) Eligible Shareholder Information. Within the time period specified in this Section 2.3 for delivering the Proxy Access Notice, an Eligible Shareholder (including each Constituent Holder) must provide, in writing to the Corporate Secretary and with respect to such Eligible Shareholder (and each Constituent Holder):
- (a) the name and address of, and number of Voting Shares owned by, such person;
- (b) one (1) or more written statements from the record holder of the Voting Shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three (3)-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) days prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the Corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding three (3)-years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such person's agreement to provide (i) within ten (10) days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person's continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the record date, together with any additional information reasonably requested to verify such person's ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares; and (ii) immediate notice if the Eligible Shareholder ceases to own any of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting of shareholders;
- (c) the information that would be required to be submitted pursuant to Section 2.1(3)(a);
- (d) a representation as to the number of Voting Shares it asserts it is deemed to own for purposes of this Section 2.3 and a representation that such person:

10

Board at the annual meeting any person other than the Shareholder Nominee being nominated pursuant to this Section 2.3;

- (v) will not distribute to any shareholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the Corporation;
- (vi) will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the Corporation and its shareholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section 2.3;
- (e) in the case of a nomination by a group of shareholders that together is an Eligible Shareholder, the designation by all group members of one (1) group member that is authorized to act on behalf of all members of the nominating shareholder group with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination; and
- (f) an undertaking that such person agrees to:
- (i) assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation (and affiliates of the Corporation) and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the Corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Eligible Shareholder's communications with the shareholders of the Corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Shareholder (including such person) provided to the Corporation; and
- (ii) file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " Commission ") any solicitation by the Eligible Shareholder of shareholders of the Corporation relating to the annual meeting at which the Shareholder Nominee will be nominated, regardless of whether any such filing is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act or whether any exemption from filing is available for such solicitation or other communication under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act.

11

In addition, within the time period specified in this Section 2.3 for delivering the Proxy Access Notice, a Qualifying Fund whose stock ownership is counted for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder must provide to the Corporate Secretary documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Board that demonstrates that each of the funds included within a Qualifying Fund satisfies the requirements set forth in Section 2.3(5). In order to be considered timely, any information required by this Section 2.3 to be provided to the Corporation must be supplemented (by delivery to the Corporate Secretary) (A) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (B) no later than the fifth (5 th ) day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Shareholder or other person to change or add any proposed Shareholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these Bylaws) available to the Corporation relating to any defect.

- (7) Eligible Shareholder Statement. The Eligible Shareholder may provide to the Corporate Secretary, at the time the information required by this Section 2.3 is originally provided pursuant to a Proxy Access Notice, a single written statement of the Eligible Shareholder (including such single statement as may be submitted by a group comprising such Eligible Shareholder) for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee (the " Statement "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.3, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes is materially false or misleading, omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or would violate any applicable law or regulation.
- (8) Shareholder Nominee Information. Within the time period specified in this Section 2.3 for delivering the Proxy Access Notice, each Shareholder Nominee must provide to the Corporate Secretary:
- (a) an executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the Board or its designee (which form shall be provided by the Corporation reasonably promptly upon written request of a shareholder), that such Shareholder Nominee consents to being named in the Corporation's proxy statement and form of proxy card (and will not agree to be named in any other person's proxy statement or form of proxy card) as a nominee and to serving as a director of the Corporation if elected;
- (b) the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Article III Section 12;

12

- (i) has any direct or indirect relationship with the Corporation other than those relationships that have been deemed categorically immaterial pursuant to the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines; and
- (ii) is or has ever been subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the Commission.
- (e) an undertaking that such Person will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the Corporation and its shareholders that are or will be true and correct in all material respects (and shall not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading).

At the request of the Corporation, the Shareholder Nominee must submit all other completed and signed questionnaires required of directors and officers of the Corporation. The Corporation may request such additional information as necessary to permit the Board to determine if each Shareholder Nominee satisfies the requirements of this Section 2.3 or if each Shareholder Nominee is independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the Common Stock of the Corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board in determining and disclosing the independence of directors or as may otherwise be reasonably requested.

In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) or the Shareholder Nominee to the Corporation or its shareholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, each Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Corporate Secretary of any defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these Bylaws) available to the Corporation relating to any such defect.

- (9) Ineligible Shareholder Nominee. Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation's proxy materials for a particular annual meeting of shareholders but withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at that

13

annual meeting (other than by reason of such Shareholder Nominee's disability) will be ineligible to be a Shareholder Nominee pursuant to this Section 2.3 for the next two (2) annual meetings. Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation's proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of shareholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this Section 2.3 or any other provision of these Bylaws, the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of shareholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of shareholders and, for the avoidance of doubt, another individual may not be substituted for such Shareholder Nominee by the Eligible Shareholder that nominated such Shareholder Nominee. The Corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 2.3, any Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of shareholders or to allow the nomination of any such Shareholder Nominees, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation, if the Corporation has received one (1) or more shareholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 2.1(2) of these Bylaws.

- (10) Inclusion of Shareholder Nominee in Proxy. The Corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 2.3, a Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of shareholders or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to allow the nomination of a Shareholder Nominee, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation:
- (a) (i) who is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the Common Stock of the Corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board in determining and disclosing independence of the directors, in each case as determined by the Board, (ii) who does not meet the audit committee independence requirements under the rules of any stock exchange on which the Corporation's securities are traded and applicable securities laws , (iii) who is not a "non-employee director" for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule), or (iv) who is not independent for the purposes of the requirements under the FDIC Improvement Act related to designation as an "outside director";
- (b) whose election or service as a member of the Board would violate or cause the Corporation to be in violation of these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the Common Stock is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation;
- (c) who is or has been, within the past three (3) years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914;
- (d) (i) whose election as a member of the Board would cause the

14

Corporation to seek, or assist in the seeking of, advance approval or to obtain, or assist in the obtaining of, an interlock waiver pursuant to the rules or regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or (ii) who is a director, trustee, officer or employee with management functions for any depository institution, depository institution holding company or entity that has been designated as a Systemically Important Financial Institution, each as defined in the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act, provided, however, that this clause (ii) shall apply only so long as the Corporation is subject to compliance with Section 164 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act;

- (e) who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten (10) years;

- (g) if such Shareholder Nominee or the applicable Eligible Shareholder (including each member of any group of shareholders and beneficial owners that together is an Eligible Shareholder) shall have provided information to the Corporation in respect of such nomination that was untrue in any material respect or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, as determined by the Board or any committee thereof, in each case, in its sole discretion;
- (h) if the Eligible Shareholder or applicable Shareholder Nominee otherwise contravenes any of the agreements or representations made by such Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee or fails to comply with its obligations pursuant to these Bylaws, including, but not limited to, this Section 2.3; or
- (i) if the Eligible Shareholder ceases to be an Eligible Shareholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting.

For the purposes of this Section 2.3(10)(a)-(f) and, to the extent related to a breach, action or failure by the Shareholder Nominee, Section 2.3(10)(g) or (h) will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.3 of the specific Shareholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of such Shareholder Nominee to be nominated; provided, however, that clause (i) (and, to the extent related to a breach, action or failure by an Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder), clause (g) or (h)) will result in the Voting Shares owned by such Eligible

15

Shareholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible Shareholder, the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 2.3 of all of the applicable shareholder's Shareholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of shareholders or, if the proxy statement has already been filed, the ineligibility of all of such shareholder's Shareholder Nominees to be nominated).

This Section 2.3 shall be the exclusive method for shareholders to require that nominees for directors be included in the Corporation's proxy materials.

## 2.4 General.

No person may be appointed, nominated or elected as a director unless such person, at the time such person is nominated and appointed or elected, would then be able to serve as a director without conflicting in any manner with any state, federal or foreign law or regulation applicable to the Corporation, as determined in good faith by the Board. Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws, the Chair of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 2, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.

## 3. Place of Meetings

Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place as the Board may designate.

## 4. Notice of Meetings.

Written notice of every meeting of the shareholders shall be given, either personally, by electronic transmission or by mail, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting at least five (5) days prior to the day named for the meeting, unless a greater period of notice is required by law.

If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid, addressed to the shareholder at such shareholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation. If notice is given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be given at the times provided in the PBCL. Notice of a meeting may be waived in writing and attendance at a meeting shall itself constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting except where a person attends a meeting solely for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Any previously scheduled meeting of the shareholders may be postponed, and (unless the Articles of Incorporation otherwise provide) any special meeting of the shareholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the Board upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of shareholders.

## 5. Quorum.

The presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast on the particular matter shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of considering such matter. At a duly organized meeting, except as may be otherwise specified in the Articles of Incorporation or provided by law, each matter shall be decided upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class. The Chair of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time to such time and place as they may determine, whether or not there is a quorum. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law. The shareholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may

continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

## 6. Record Date.

The Board may fix a record date which, except in the case of an adjourned meeting, shall not be more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or distribution, or the date for the allotment of rights or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares will be made or go into effect. Only such shareholders as shall be shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be entitled to notice of, or to vote at such meeting or to receive such allotment of rights or to exercise such rights, as the case may be. A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

## 8. Conduct of Meetings; Attendance at Meetings.

The Board shall designate whether the Chair, the CEO, or such other director as the Board may determine shall preside at each meeting of the Board. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, any or all directors may participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting.

If the notice is given by facsimile, email or other electronic means, it shall be deemed given when sent to facsimile number or email address, appearing in the records of the Corporation or supplied by such director to the Corporation for purpose of notice. Reference in these Bylaws to "written" or "in writing" includes electronic transmission. Electronic transmission means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.

20

with the Corporate Secretary in record form signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, will be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Except in the case of a special meeting of directors, neither the business to be transacted nor the purpose of the meeting need be specified in the waiver of notice of such meeting. Attendance of a person either in person or by proxy, when permitted, will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

## 11. Compensation of Directors.

Each director who is not a salaried employee of the Corporation or its affiliates may receive compensation in such manner and at such time as the Board may determine and be reimbursed for their meeting attendance expenses.

## 12. Submission of Questionnaire, Representation and Agreement.

To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation, a person must deliver (in accordance with the applicable time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under Article II, Section 2) to the Corporate Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation a written questionnaire (in the form provided by the Corporate Secretary upon written request) with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Corporate Secretary upon written request) that such person (a) is not and will not become a party to (i) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director, will act or vote on any issue or question (a " Voting Commitment ") that has not been disclosed to the Corporation or (ii) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person's ability to comply, if elected as a director, with such person's fiduciary duties under applicable law, (b) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed to the Corporation, (c) will serve as a director if so elected and, in such person's individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director of the Corporation, and will comply with all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation and (d) will abide by the requirements of Article III, Section 13.

## 13. Procedure for Election of Directors; Required Vote.

21

(1) Election of Directors at all meetings of the shareholders at which directors are to be elected shall be by ballot and, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of the Corporation's preferred stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present shall elect directors. For purposes of these Bylaws, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of these Bylaws, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination thereof being made by the Corporate Secretary as of the close of the applicable notice of nomination period set forth in Article II, Section 2 of these Bylaws, based on whether one (1) or more notice(s) of nomination were timely filed in accordance with said Article II, Section 2; provided, however, that the determination that an election is a "contested election" shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity. If, prior to the time the Corporation mails its initial proxy statement in connection with such election of directors, one (1) or more notices of nomination are withdrawn such that the number of candidates for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the election shall not be considered a contested election, but in all other cases, once an election is determined to be a contested election, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.

(2) If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor was elected at the meeting at which the director was not re-elected, the director shall promptly tender such director's resignation to the Board in accordance with the agreement contemplated by Article III, Section 12 of these Bylaws. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders a resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee or the decision of the Board with respect to such director's resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until such director's

22

successor is duly elected, or such director's earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board pursuant to these Bylaws, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 3 of these Bylaws or may decrease the size of the Board pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 1 of these Bylaws.

- (3) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter shall be the act of the shareholders.

29

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and federal banking laws and regulations, have no personal liability for monetary damages for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, as a director, provided that this Article VII shall not eliminate the liability of a director in any case where such elimination is not permitted by applicable laws and regulations. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director for or with respect to any act or failure to act on the part of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

## 2. Indemnification.

(1) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, legislative or other (each, a " Proceeding "), by reason of the fact that such person (or another person for whom such person is the legal representative) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another bank, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise ("Covered Person"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and federal banking laws and regulation as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by the Covered Person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Person's, executors and administrators. If authorized by the Board, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person to the full extent permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and federal banking laws and regulations.

(2) In connection with any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding for which the Covered Person may be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII, Section 2, the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by such Covered Person in any such Proceeding in advance of final disposition of such Proceeding (an "advancement of expenses"), subject, if required by applicable law, to receipt by the Corporation of a written undertaking, by or on behalf of such Covered Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it is (a) ultimately determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article VII, Section 2, or (b) found that the Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification under applicable

30

federal banking laws and regulation.

- (3) The Corporation will not, in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by a Covered Person, advance expenses to such person or, except as provided in Article VII, Section 2(5), indemnify such person pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 unless the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
- (4) To obtain indemnification under this Article VII, Section 2, a Covered Person shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Covered Person and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Covered Person is entitled to indemnification (each a " Claimant "). Upon written request by a Claimant for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2(4), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the Claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the Claimant, by Independent Counsel (as defined below), or (b) if no request is made by the Claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as defined below), or (ii) if a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Claimant, or (iii) if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by the shareholders of the Corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the Claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board unless there shall have occurred within two (2) years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a "Change of Control" with respect to the Corporation, as defined in The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 2016 Directors Deferred Stock Unit Program (as amended or replaced), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Claimant unless the Claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board. If it is so determined that the Claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the Claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. As used herein, (a) " Independent Counsel " means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the Claimant in an action to determine the Claimant's rights under this Article VII, Section 2, and (b) " Disinterested Directors " means a director of the Corporation who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the Claimant.
- (5) If a written claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after such claim has been received by the Corporation, the Claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of any such claim, and if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, the Claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of

31

prosecuting such suit. It shall be a defense to any such suit (other than a suit to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses where the required undertaking has been received by the Corporation) that indemnification of the Claimant would not be permitted by applicable law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board, Independent Counsel or shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any suit seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 that indemnification or advancement of expenses is proper in the circumstances, nor a determination by the Corporation (including the Board, Independent Counsel or shareholders) that indemnification or advancement of expenses is not proper in the circumstances, shall, in itself, create a presumption that the Claimant is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 or be a defense to any such suit.

- (6) If any provision or provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 (including without limitation each portion of any paragraph of this Article VII, Section 2 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the full extent possible, the provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 (including without limitation each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VII, Section 2 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision or provisions held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
- (7) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(4) that the Claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(5).
- (8) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(5) that the procedures and presumptions of this Article VII, Section 2 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article VII, Section 2.
- (9) If a Claimant is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 for some or a portion of the expense, liability and loss incurred or suffered by such person in connection with any Proceeding but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall indemnify the Claimant for the portion thereof to which the Claimant is entitled.
- (10) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in this Article VII, Section 2: (a) shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Covered Person and shall inure to the benefit of a Covered Person's heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives; and (b) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any director, officer, employee, agent or other person

32

may be entitled in any capacity as a matter of law or under any charter provision, by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or directors, or otherwise. Any repeal, amendment or modification of this Article VII, Section 2 or adoption of any other provision of the Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation which has the effect of limiting the rights set forth in this Article VII, Section 2 shall operate prospectively only and shall not affect any rights or obligations with respect to actions, omissions, circumstances or events occurring prior to the adoption of any such repeal, amendment or modification. Each Covered Person shall be deemed to be serving as such in reliance on the provisions of this Article VII, Section 2. Nothing in this Article VII, Section 2 shall require the Corporation to take any action that would be prohibited by applicable law.

- 3. Indemnification of Employees and Agents.

The Corporation may provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation up to the full extent of the provisions of Article VII, Section 2 of these Bylaws with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.
